# First-Game
My first game made with Unity and C#


This project is a 2D space shooter my friends and I made as a class project. They did all the sprites and i was in charge of programming the game in Unity engine.

As it was my first game, it was quite of a challange at first, but then i started to get confident and i added more features. 
Feel free to try it out!
I would really appreciate your feedback and tips for future games, thanks for reading and i hope you enjoy!! ^.^
